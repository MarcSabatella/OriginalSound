Original Sound

Original Sound allows you to disable the default audio input processing
that is performed by the Zoom PWA and other web-based applications.
This processing is normally useful for voice
but disastrous for music.
Two separate controls are included:
one for echo cancellation,
and one for other other voice optimizations
including auto gain control and noise supression.

Note: in order for the settings to take effect,
you will need to change audio devices,
or disconnect and reconnect the audio,
using whatever controls the app you are using provides.
